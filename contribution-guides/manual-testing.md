# Manual Testing

To ensure the final executable works as a complete package (including the UI), a bit of manual testing with the final binaries is required. This should eventually be reduced as the E2E test suite becomes more complete. Everything below that can be E2E tested should be.

If time allows, test the following on the binaries for all OSes. If not, test on at least one.

## Updating the Documentation

rotki is continuously changing, and sometimes documentation becomes outdated. One way to contribute to rotki is by helping to keep the documentation up to date. To do so, you have to edit the corresponding section in the `.rst` files inside the `docs` folder of the git repo.

To review your changes, you can compile the documentation using the command:

```sh
make html
```

inside the `docs` folder.

### Guide Screenshots

When updating the user guide documentation, you might need to update the application screenshots.

![Capturing screenshots](/images/contrib_screen.png)

To be consistent, use the Chrome Developer Tools in the Electron application to capture the screenshots.

First, toggle the device toolbar (1).

If this is the first time you are taking a screenshot, click on the **Dimensions** dropdown menu and select **Edit** (2).

![Adding a custom screen resolution](/images/contrib_dimens.png)

You will be given the option to **Add custom device**. Use the following settings:

- **Resolution**: 1600x900
- **DPR**: 1

In the user agent, ensure that **Desktop** is selected. Then, save the entry.

After making sure that this entry is selected, press the overflow menu (3) and select **Capture Screenshot** to capture a new screenshot.
