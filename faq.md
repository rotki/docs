# Frequently Asked Questions

## Questions on the application

### What is rotki?

rotki is an open-source portfolio tracking, analytics, and tax reporting application that respects your privacy. It is focused on crypto assets but will also slowly facilitate tracking of more traditional assets.

### Why should I use it?

Unlike virtually every other service out there which offers you the ability to track crypto assets, get analytics, and generate tax reports, rotki is a local application. And its basic version is also free.

A local application allows you to **own your data**. You don't need to give your API keys, or any of your financial history to a centralized third party. We strongly advise against using any such centralized services. Your data is not safe with them.

### What does it offer me?

rotki offers tracking of all your crypto assets no matter where they are. Either on a blockchain or on one of the supported exchanges.

You can also manually input information on your Fiat assets (i.e., how much EUR, USD, etc. you own) so that the analytics also take them into account. Manual input of actions that you did and would like to be tracked is also possible by adding an "external trade".

It also allows you to get a tax report, essentially calculating all trades in a given period and determining your profit or loss depending on your given settings. For more details on what is offered and how to use it check the [Usage Guide](/usage-guides/).

### Will it remain free to use?

rotki's base version will always remain open-source and free to use. It's on GitHub and even if the current maintainer stops developing for whatever reason, anyone can pick it up and continue.

## Common Issues

### Restoring backed up database at new account creation fails

Please, make sure you are using your premium subscription API keys/secret and the same password.

### Data with multiple accounts/devices is not synced

Please, make sure all your accounts have the "Allow data sync with rotki Server" switched on, and that on each log-in you make the appropriate choice when prompted to replace the local database. See the section [Sync data with rotki server](/usage-guides/#sync-data-with-rotki-server) for more information about how to sync data with multiple accounts/devices.

### ENS data not updating for newly registered name/address combination

If you just registered your ENS name and you don't see the name and/or avatar being properly displayed in rotki, then that means that the value is cached and you need to force a refresh. You can do that by going to `Accounts & Balances → Blockchain Balances` view and pressing the refresh button next to the Ethereum balances table.

### My asset is not showing in rotki

If your asset is not showing in rotki, even though you are sure that you have a balance, you need to first ensure that the asset is present on the list of assets (read [inspecting list of assets](/usage-guides/assets.html#inspecting-list-of-assets)).

If you still cannot find your asset, it might be ignored. By default, rotki only displays un-ignored assets in the table. To also show the ignored assets, choose the `Filter by ignored status → Show all`, and then unignore the asset manually. Additionally, you can whitelist the asset to prevent it from being automatically ignored by rotki's spam detection (read: [whitelisting of ignored assets](/usage-guides/assets.html#whitelisting-of-ignored-assets)).

After whitelisting the token, you may need to re-detect it to see it in your balances (read: [token detection methods](/usage-guides/assets.html#whitelisting-and-re-detecting-missing-tokens)).

If the asset is still not showing, you may need to add it manually.

### My balances are not showing after importing my history/creating history events

It's not a bug. At the moment, we don't use events to determine current holdings. Balances are only calculated from connected exchanges, connected blockchain addresses, and manual balances.
