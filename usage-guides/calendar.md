# Calendar

rotki provides a calendar view where you can add and track events for your activities. You can also set reminders to perform some actions related to these events.

Here the non-obvious fields are:

- **Notify me at event time**: Whether to also notify the user at the event time. If this setting is turned off, rotki will not notify you at the event time, other than the reminder you set beforehand.
- **Delete event once it has passed**: Whether to remove events after the time has passed. We recommend turning this feature on to save space, unless you want to keep the event.

## Automatic events

rotki can also create automatic events based on your on-chain activity. The events that rotki currently can check include:

- ENS Expiration & Renewal

You can customize how rotki handles automatic events by clicking the `setting` icon at the top.
