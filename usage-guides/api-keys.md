### Steps to Add Exchange API Key:

1. Create API key on your exchange (see [API key permissions](#api-key-permissions))
2. Navigate to `API Keys > Exchanges` in the left sidebar
3. Click button `Add an exchange` to open addition menu
4. Enter your:
   - API Key
   - API Secret (for the majority of exchanges)
   - Password (for some exchanges)
5. Click `Save`

### After Adding:

- Successful addition: Exchange will appear in your list
- If failed:

  - Verify key and secret are correct
  - Some exchanges may have issues due to timestamp difference between the computer and the server (e.g. binance, read [this](https://github.com/tiagosiebler/awesome-crypto-examples/wiki/Timestamp-for-this-request-is-outside-of-the-recvWindow))

### Sync Settings:

- Option to enable/disable exchange synchronization
- Consider disabling to avoid IP bans from frequent syncs

> **Note**: At the moment, [margin trades](https://github.com/rotki/rotki/issues/1980) and [future trades](https://github.com/rotki/rotki/issues/1606) are not yet supported in rotki.

### API key permissions

rotki only needs read-only permissions for your accounts. As a general rule, exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase Pro) group all the read-only permissions as "read" or "view".

![Simple API key permissions](/images/add_exchange_api_keys_binance.png)

In the case of an exchange providing a more granular permissions scheme (e.g., Coinbase, Kraken) or having additional options (e.g., query limits, passphrase), refer to the exchange documentation or get in touch via their customer support channel.

![Granular API key permissions](/images/add_exchange_api_keys_coinbase.png)

You may also try creating an API key with the minimum read-related permissions, then adding it in rotki and finally checking that the connection was successful and data was loaded as expected. Otherwise, try again adding more read-related permissions.

#### Kraken

When inputting the API key for Kraken, you need to specify the type of your Kraken account, which depends on your Kraken account verification level. Refer to [this](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001395743-Verification-levels-explained) for more information.

![Kraken account type](/images/exchanges_add_kraken.png)

#### Binance / Binance US

To improve the speed of querying trade information using the Binance API, you can specify which market pairs to query instead of querying all possible pairs. This reduces the number of requests made to Binance servers, avoiding potential rate limits and failures. To select specific markets, edit your Binance exchange instance configuration.

![Edit Binance in the exchanges section](/images/exchanges_edit_binance.png)

And choose the markets in the `Filter market pair(s)` search.

Once finished, click on save.

## External services

### Why External API Keys Are Needed

Required for accessing:

- Historical crypto prices
- EVM transactions
- Other external data services

### How to External Add API Keys:

1. Create free account on service website
2. Generate API key
3. In rotki:
   - Go to `API Keys → External Services`
   - Enter your API key(s)

![External services](/images/external_services.png)

### Etherscan

We **strongly recommend** getting an Etherscan API Key - it's completely free and will make the queries much faster!
Without it, the queries will be really slow. You just need to:

1. Create an account at [here](https://etherscan.io/register)
2. Generate a free API Key
3. Add the key to rotki.

You only need one Etherscan API key for all EVM chains since the key is now unified.

### Loopring balances

To have your Loopring balances detected, you will need an API Key from Loopring. To get one, visit [Loopring Security](https://loopring.io/#/layer2/security) and unlock your account. In the list of options, click on **Export Account**.

![Get Loopring keys](/images/get_loopring_keys.png)

Then in rotki, you need to add the API key in the `Loopring` section.

After following these steps, your balances in the dashboard will be updated including the Loopring information.

![Loopring balances in the UI](/images/loopring_balances.png)

### Monerium

As long as you provide Monerium credentials, all Monerium transactions on Mainnet, Polygon, and Gnosis chain will be decorated with bank data (or chain bridging data), which you can also see in the Monerium app.

1. For bank transfers from/to your address, you will be able to see the destination/source IBAN along with the memo of the transfer.
2. For automatic EURe bridging between EVM chains, you will see amounts, from/to EVM chains along with from/to address.

![Monerium decorated transactions](/images/monerium_transactions.png)

> **Note**: Monerium API can only use basic authentication at the moment. We are in contact with their team and they will add API keys eventually. But for now, they only have basic authentication, which means your username and password are stored in rotki (encrypted). Take necessary security precautions and don't use unless you understand the potential risks.

### Gnosis Pay

You can integrate Gnosis Pay with rotki to import your transaction data. This feature is only available for premium users.

#### Adding Gnosis Pay Session Token

To add your Gnosis Pay session token:

1. **Login to Gnosis Pay:**

   - Go to [Gnosis Pay](https://app.gnosispay.com/dashboard) and log in to your account.

2. **Retrieve the Session Token:**

   - Open your browser's developer tools (right-click on the page and select `Inspect` or press `F12` / `Ctrl+Shift+I`/`Cmd+Option+I`).
   - Go to the **Application** tab in the developer tools.
   - In the **Storage** section on the left sidebar, click on **Cookies** and select `https://app.gnosispay.com` (marked as **1** in the image).
   - Look for the cookie named `__Secure-authjs.session-token` in the list (marked as **2** in the image).
   - Copy the value of the cookie from the **Cookie Value** section at the bottom (marked as **3** in the image).

   ![Retrieve Gnosis Pay Session Token](/images/gnosispay_add_key.png)

3. **Add Session Token to rotki:**

   - In rotki, navigate to `API Keys → External Services`.
   - Scroll to the **Gnosis Pay** section.
   - Paste the session token into the **Session Token** field.
   - Click **Save**.

> **Note**: The session token only provides read-only access to your Gnosis Pay data

### The Graph

rotki uses The Graph to obtain Balancer balances and particular ENS data. You can create one [here](https://thegraph.com/studio/apikeys).

![Create The Graph API key](/images/create_the_graph_api_key.png)

After creating the API key, you can add it to rotki. Additionally, ensure that the generated API key is authorized for the Balancer and ENS subgraphs.

### DefiLlama

rotki integrates with DefiLlama for price data. An API key is not required, but a paid API key will provide higher rate limits. You can find more information about their API [here](https://defillama.com/pro-api).

### CoinGecko

rotki uses CoinGecko for cryptocurrency data. An API key is not required, but a paid API key will provide higher rate limits. You can find more information about their API [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
