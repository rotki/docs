# Onchain Transactions

rotki allows you to perform onchain transactions by connecting your wallet (either through a browser wallet or WalletConnect).
At the moment rotki only supports sending native tokens and ERC-20 tokens on all supported EVM chains.

::: info
You can only send tokens from an address that is registered as an EVM account in rotki. Otherwise, rotki won't be able to retrieve the list of tokens.

## Connect to a Browser Wallet from the Electron App

If you're using rotki via the Electron app, you won't be able to connect directly to your browser wallet. Instead, rotki provides a bridge for this purpose. Follow these steps:

1. Click the "Open Browser Wallet Bridge" button. This will open a page in your browser.

2. On the bridge page, the first step is to connect it to your browser wallet.

3. Once connected, the page should display your wallet status.

4. Now youâ€™ll need the `WalletConnect Pair URI`. Go back to the Electron app, click `Connect Wallet`, and choose `WalletConnect`.

5. Wait for the QR code to appear, then click `Copy Link`. The Pair URI will be copied to your clipboard. It will look something like this:
   `wc:0579c1fee69aad512b6ef19a977a08f6c60b19415661cfa2882039da038a24fb@2?relay-protocol=irn&symKey=55d16a7cfc2198dfc1058254a7862c98aad401814bb86219041687d5b6de4020&expiryTimestamp=1744297123`

6. Return to the bridge page in your browser, paste the Pair URI, and click `Start Pairing`.

You're now connected and can perform transactions from the Electron app.

## Troubleshooting

1. **I keep getting a "could not coalesce" error:**

If you get an error looking like this in the console:

```
Error: could not coalesce error (error={ "code": "INVALID_ARGUMENT", "message": "" }, payload={ "id": 6, "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_sendTransaction", "params": [ { "from": "0xfoo", "gas": "0x5208", "nonce": "0x1f4", "to": "0x6ea158145907a1fac74016087611913a96d96624", "value": "0x38d7ea4c68000" } ] }, code=UNKNOWN_ERROR, version=6.14.0)
```

You can clear the cache (Help > Clear Cache), and then restart the app.

2. **Cannot switch chain from the app.**

At the moment, if you connect using the browser wallet bridge, you can switch chains only through the wallet directly and not from the rotki app.
