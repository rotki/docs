# rotki data directory

rotki saves user data by default in a different directory per OS. For each OS, data is stored in the respective standards-compliant equivalent directory.

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/rotki/data/`
- **OSX**: `~/Library/Application Support/rotki/data` - please note this folder is hidden by default
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/rotki/data`

Before v1.6.0, rotki was saving data in `$USER/.rotkehlchen`. From v1.6.0, that directory got migrated to the OS equivalent standard directory, and it should be safe for users to delete the old directory as long as the new directory contains the migrated DB.

A very good idea for the rotki data directory would be to make frequent backups of it as it contains all of the data of all of your rotki accounts and cache data for historical price queries.
