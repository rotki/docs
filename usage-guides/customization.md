# Customizing

This section provides information on how to customize the application through the settings. Click on the user icon on the top right and choose "Settings" to access basic customization options.

## Profit Currency

rotki calculates everything, including your total profit/loss during the PnL report, in a given fiat currency, called the `profit_currency`. By default, this is USD. You can change this by clicking on the currency icon in the top right menu and selecting your preferred currency.

![Changing the profit currency](/images/sc_profit_currency.png)

## Application Settings

Access the settings menu via `User icon → Settings`. By choosing the "General" settings button, you can customize general application settings.

![Customizing the general app settings](/images/sc_general_settings.png)

### General Settings

#### Language

> Set the language used in the app. This feature is experimental and may not work as expected for some languages. Help us speed up the translation process by contributing [here](/contribution-guides/contribute-as-developer.html#add-a-new-language-or-translation).

#### Anonymous Usage Analytics

> Specify whether the application can submit anonymous usage analytics. This helps measure active users while ensuring data is anonymized and contains no sensitive information.

#### Balance Data Saving Frequency

> Set how often (in hours) the balance data is saved. This data helps calculate statistics and historical data for the user.

#### Date Display Format

> Set the date display format in the rotki user interface, such as `%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S` for month/day/year hour:minutes:seconds. Check [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) for valid formats.

#### Display in Local Time

> Choose whether to display local time or UTC in CSV exports, user logs, and other locations.

#### BTC Derivation Gap Limit

> Set the derivation gap limit for deriving addresses from a bitcoin xpub. More information [here](https://insights.blockonomics.co/bitcoin-what-is-this-gap-limit/).

#### Treat Staked ETH as ETH

> If enabled, ETH2 (staked ETH) will appear as ETH in the UI, and all tables and charts will combine the values of ETH and ETH2.

#### EVM Chains for Automatic Detection

> Configure which EVM chains should not automatically detect tokens. By default, EVM chains detect activities of all registered EVM accounts in other EVM chains.

### Amount Settings

![Customizing the app's amount settings](/images/sc_amount_settings.png)

#### Floating Precision

> Set the number of decimal points shown in the UI for floating point numbers.

#### Main Currency

> Same as [changing the profit currency](#profit-currency).

#### Thousands Separator

> Set the symbol separating every 3 digits for large numbers, e.g., `1,000,000`.

#### Decimal Separator

> Set the symbol separating the floating part of a number, e.g., `5.42`.

#### Use Abbreviations for Large Numbers

> If enabled, large numbers will be abbreviated, e.g., `1,234,567` as `1.23 M`. Set the minimum value to be abbreviated.

#### Currency Location

> Set whether the currency symbol appears before or after the number, e.g., `$1,000` or `1,000$`.

#### Amount Rounding

> Choose the rounding mechanism: `Round up`, `Round down`, or `Half even`. Customize how amounts and values are rounded.

### RPC Node Setting

This setting lets you change the nodes used to connect to blockchains. We give you a list of public nodes, but sometimes they are busy or down. You will see a green or red icon showing if a node is working.

It is good to add more nodes and set their priority. We always try your own nodes first, then use some random public nodes if needed. If you don't have your own node, we use public nodes.

The node's weight (percentage) shows how likely it is to be used. You can turn nodes on or off with the toggle button.

![Customizing the app's connection to EVM nodes](/images/rotki_nodes_management.png)

In this menu you can also edit, delete or add more nodes.

![Add an EVM node](/images/rotki_nodes_management_addition.png)

### Local Nodes

#### Connecting to a Kusama Client

> rotki attempts to connect to a local Kusama node running on the default port `9933`. If no client is running, blockchain queries will use an external service.

#### Connecting to a Polkadot Client

> Set the RPC endpoint for a Polkadot node here.

#### Connecting to an ETH Consensus Layer Beacon Node

> Set the RPC endpoint for the Ethereum consensus layer beacon node. If unreachable, beaconcha.in will be used. For DAppNode Ethereum validator users, find the RPC node setting in the DAppNode Package for the Execution Client.

### Price Oracle Settings

![Customizing the app's price oracle settings](/images/sc_priceoracle_settings.png)

Here, you can customize the order in which price oracles are queried, both for current and historical prices. This determines which price source to check first, second, and so on.

DeFi oracles like Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3 use only on-chain information to get current prices. This makes querying a bit slower, but it relies solely on the Ethereum chain. Prices for some assets may differ from Coingecko or CryptoCompare, depending on the conditions of the pools at the time of the query.

### NFT Settings

![Customizing the app's NFT settings](/images/sc_nf_settings.png)

#### Include NFTs in Graphs and Total Amounts

> Decide whether to include NFTs in total net worth calculations and displayed graphs.

#### NFT Images Rendering Setting

> For privacy, allow images from all or specific domains. More details [here](https://medium.com/@alxlpsc/critical-privacy-vulnerability-getting-exposed-by-metamask-693c63c2ce94).

### External Service Settings

> Define rules for retry and timeout for external service calls made by rotki.

### Frontend Only Settings

![Customizing the app's frontend only settings](/images/sc_frontendonly_settings1.png)

#### Animation Effect

> Reduce animation effects to improve performance. This affects animation quality but optimizes resource usage.

#### Alias Name for Addresses

> Enable or disable alias names for blockchain addresses. Aliases are obtained from `ENS`, `addressbook`, or `blockchain account label`. Change the order of resolution as needed.

#### Data Scrambling

> Enable data scrambling to randomize amounts, dates, and other data for privacy in screenshots. This setting does not persist across sessions.

#### Dashboard Graph Default Timeframe

> Set the default timeframe for the dashboard graph, which will be pre-selected upon login.

#### Graph Basis

> Configure whether the graph y-axis starts at 0 or the minimum amount for the period.

#### Automatic Balance Refresh

> Enable or disable automatic balance refresh and set the refresh interval. Disabled by default due to potential slow queries and rate limits.

#### Periodic Status Query

> Set the frequency of backend data updates. Default is 5 seconds.

![Customizing the app's frontend only settings](/images/sc_frontendonly_settings2.png)

#### Blockchain Explorer Customization

> Customize which explorer is used for transaction and address links.

#### Theme [Premium]

> Premium users can customize colors for light or dark mode.

## Accounting Settings

By choosing the "Accounting" settings button, you can customize application settings related to accounting calculations.

Understand each setting, consult with a tax accountant for your jurisdiction, and then set them appropriately.

The default settings are currently tailored for the German tax jurisdiction. For example, all profit/loss calculations are done on a first-in/first-out basis, and profits from selling crypto assets after 1 year are non-taxable. These settings can be adjusted.

### Custom Accounting Rules

![Customizing the accounting rules](/images/sc_accounting_custom_rule.png)

Customize accounting rules based on `Event type`, `Event sub type`, and `Counterparty`.

### Trade Settings

![Customizing the accounting trade settings](/images/sc_accounting_settings.png)

#### Crypto to Crypto Trades

A setting to determine whether crypto to crypto trades or any events that spend crypto are taxable and should be taken into account. By default it’s `True`.

:::tabs
== Crypto to Crypto Trades

> **Illustration:**
> You trade your `1 ETH`, to get `11 USDT`. Current price of ETH is `10 EUR`, but you bought it when it was `5 EUR`.

1. If `True`, virtual trades are generated, and profits/losses are calculated based on the difference in asset prices. By making this trade, we will create two virtual trade, which are:

   - **Virtual Trade 1**: Sell `1 ETH` for `10 EUR`. PnL of this virtual trade is calculated as `the value when you sell this ETH (10 EUR)` minus `the value when you bought this ETH (5 EUR)` = `5 EUR`.
   - **Virtual Trade 2**: Buy `11 USDT` with `10 EUR`. PnL of this virtual trade is `0 EUR` because it's a buy. However, later on, when you trade this `USDT` with another crypto, point (1) will also be applied.
     > **Total PnL** = `5 EUR`.

2. If `False`, no virtual trades are generated, and no additional profits/losses are calculated.
   > **Total PnL** = `0 EUR`.

== Crypto Spending

> **Illustration:**
> You have `1` ETH that you bought with price `50 EUR`. Then you spend this `1` ETH for gas fees, and the price at the moment is `100 EUR`.

1. If `True`, when you use crypto for fees, donations, or purchases, the profit and loss (PnL) calculation shows two things: the loss from spending the crypto and any profit or loss from the difference between the asset's current price and its buying price.

   - **Loss from spending** = `-100 EUR`.
   - **Profit from price difference** = `100 EUR (spend price) - 50 EUR (buy price) = 50 EUR`.
     > **Total PnL** = `-100 EUR + 50 EUR` = `-50 EUR`.

2. If `False`, only the spending loss is considered.
   > **Total PnL** = `-100 EUR`.

:::

#### EVM Gas Costs

> Specify if EVM transaction gas costs should be counted as a loss.

#### Tax Free Period

> Specify if there is a tax-free holding period for crypto assets.

#### Asset Movements Fees

> Specify if deposit/withdrawal fees should count as expenses in profit/loss reports.

#### Calculate Past Cost Basis

> Enable or disable calculating cost basis from all past events, even before the report period.

#### Omit ETH Staking Events

> Specify if ETH staking events are taxable only after the merge and withdrawals are enabled or at the point of receiving.

#### Cost Basis Method

> Select the cost basis calculation method: `FIFO`, `LIFO`, `HIFO`, or `ACB`.

#### Include Fees in Cost Basis

A setting to determine if trade fees should be included in the cost basis of the asset being bought/sold. By default, this setting is `True`.

> **Illustration:**
> You bought `1` ETH for `10 EUR` and paid `1 EUR` fee.

:::tabs
== True

The fee event only reduces the amount of the fee asset paid. The actual fee is then used to determine the cost basis of the asset being bought or sold.

> The cost basis of that ETH is `10 + 1` = `11 EUR`. This is where the fee is taken into account.

== False

The above does not happen.

> The cost basis of that ETH is `10 EUR`. But at the time of the trade you also have a spend event of `1 EUR` as fee.

:::

### CSV Export Settings

![Customizing the CSV export settings](/images/sc_accounting_csv_export_settings.png)

#### Export Formulas

> Specify if formulas should be exported as formulas in the CSV or as actual values.

#### Have Summary

> Specify whether the all_events CSV export should include a summary of all events and the total profit/loss at the end. This summary would also include the rotki version and the settings used during the PnL report, making it easier to reproduce a report run.

## Data & Security Settings

### Changing Password

Choose the "User & Security" section to change the user password.

![Changing the user's password](/images/sc_user_password_change.png)

### Database Info & User Database Backups

View information about your user and global database, such as directory, size, and version.

![Creating database backups](/images/sc_db_backup.png)

Create new database backups, delete backups, and download backups locally.

### Exporting and Importing User Assets

Use the export/import function to migrate user assets between computers. This function creates a zip archive of user assets for transfer.

![Importing user assets](/images/sc_custom_import_export.png)

::: warning
This archive cannot be used as a backup/restore across different versions of rotki since there is no guarantee of compatibility across versions.
:::

### Reset Assets Database

There are two options to reset the assets database:

1. **Soft Reset**: This option will not reset assets added by the user.
2. **Hard Reset**: This option will reset assets added by the user.

### Purging Data

rotki keeps a lot of data cached locally. Clean this data periodically from the "Manage Data" section in the settings. Remove specific exchanges by first removing any active API keys.

![Purging user data](/images/sc_purge_data.png)

### Manage Historical Price Oracle Cache

Querying historical prices from oracles such as CryptoCompare and CoinGecko is slow and can be slower due to rate limiting. rotki creates historical price caches during idle times.

Request the creation of such a cache by going to the Oracle cache section, selecting the oracle, the from asset of the pair, the to asset of the pair, and then pressing "Cache pair prices".

![Creating a historical price cache](/images/sc_historical_price_cache.png)

Manage existing historical price cache entries, inspect start and end dates, and delete caches if needed.

## Module Settings

Choose the "Module" section of the settings to customize the enabled modules and the queried addresses for each module.

Enabling only the modules you use and specifying addresses improves querying speed.

![Managing module settings](/images/module_settings.png)

### Activating/Deactivating Modules

View all modules in the table. Some are activated by default. Enable/disable a module by toggling the switch. Re-login for changes to take effect.

### Selecting Addresses

![Select address for modules](/images/module_settings_select_address.png)

To limit querying to selected addresses, click the "edit/pencil" button on the module to select addresses. If no addresses are selected, rotki checks all eligible addresses, increasing query duration.

## Backend Settings

Desktop app users can change the default data directory and log directory via the login screen. Click the cog wheel at the bottom right to view the backend settings dialog.

![Change the backend settings](/images/rotki_backend_settings.png)

Select a new data directory, log directory, etc., and press "Save". Previously created accounts won't be accessible in the new location; move them manually.

### Advanced Backend Settings

Modify the following settings in the advanced section:

- **Max log size**: Maximum size (MB) of all logs for a single run.
- **Max number of log files**: Maximum number of backup (rotated) logs for a single run.
- **Instructions per SQLite context switch**: Specify instructions count for context switch between cooperative threads. Set to `0` to disable async DB access.
- **Log from other modules**: Include log entries from dependent libraries, not just rotki. Disabled by default.

## Disabling the Tray Icon

Disable the application tray icon by clicking the `View` menu entry in the application menu bar. Select `Display Tray Icon` to enable/disable the tray icon.
